This is a web app designed for mobile devices to completely replace waiters or be a useful tool for waiters to assist them when taking orders.

Imagine walking into a waiter-less restaurant completely operated by robots. You take seat and scan the QR code at the table to immediately being ordering. Food arrives at your table by robot or a conveyer belt. You can continue ordering more food at the palm of your hands with the app. Once you are finished eating, you pay for the food through the app and you leave the restaurant. This is the vision I have in mind with this app.

This app is designed on the front-end with HTMLS, CSS, pure Javascript, and EJS, which is a simple templating framework. On the backend, it uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to store all the customer's orders into a database.

In the future, I plan to upgrade this project on the front-end using React.js and Boostrap
